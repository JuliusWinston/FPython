# A program that asks the user for his/her password and gives or denies access based on the password

password = "opensesame"
print("Enter password to continue: ") # # Do something
typePass = input()
if typePass == password:
    print("Access Granted, You may go ahead now!")
else:
    print("You do not have access to this section, please leave!")

# for i in range(20): #Do this action exactly 20 times
#     print("Hello World!")

# i = 0
# while i < 20:
#     print("Hello world!")
#     i=i+1

# Asking Smart Programming Questions

# 1. Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did.
# 2. Specify line at which point the error occurs.
# 3. Copy and paste the entire error message and your code to the platform links you want to post.
# 4. Explain what you've already tried to do to fix the program.
# 5. List the version of python you're using.
# 6. If error occurs after a particular change, add it.
# 7. Say whether you're able to reproduce the error every time you run the program.
